              "title": "Size and Shape",
              "description": "Earth has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles) and is not a perfect sphere. It is an oblate spheroid, meaning it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator."
            },

              "title": "Surface Composition",

              "title": "Atmosphere",

            {
              "title": "Magnetic Field",
              "description": "Earth has a strong magnetic field generated by the movement of molten iron in its outer core. This magnetic field protects the planet from harmful solar and cosmic radiation."

            {
              "title": "Tectonic Plates",
              "description": "Earth's crust is divided into several large and small tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. Their movement causes earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the formation of mountains."

            {
              "title": "Seasons",

            },
            {
              "title": "Moon",
              "description": "Earth has one natural satellite, the Moon, which is the fifth largest moon in the solar system. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides and stabilizes Earth's axial tilt."

            {
              "title": "Rotation and Revolution",
              "description": "Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, resulting in day and night. It takes about 365.25 days to complete one orbit around the Sun, which defines a year. The extra 0.25 days are accounted for by adding an extra day, February 29, every four years (leap year)."
